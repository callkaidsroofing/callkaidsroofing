This backend-first engine aims to drive CKR's growth by transforming internal marketing assets into compelling ad campaigns without compromising trust or data integrity, aligning with CKR's operational philosophy (KF_06) and leveraging past job insights (KF_08) and brand guidelines (KF_01).

### 1. Campaign Creative Development
