    slug: "5-warning-signs-melbourne-roof-needs-attention",
    excerpt: "Don't wait for a leak! Learn to identify the early warning signs that indicate your Melbourne roof requires professional assessment and potential repairs.",
    content: `Melbourne homeowners face unique roofing challenges from our unpredictable weather. Spotting these warning signs early can save thousands in emergency repairs.

## 1. Interior Water Stains

**Look for these signs:**
- Brown or yellow ceiling patches
- Wall water marks  
- Peeling paint from moisture
- Musty odors

Melbourne's frequent rain and temperature swings create perfect conditions for water penetration through small roof defects.

**Action needed:** Contact us immediately - water damage spreads fast.

## 2. Ridge Cap Problems

**Visual indicators:**
- Gaps between caps and tiles
- Cracked pointing along ridges
- Displaced caps after storms
- Exposed fixing screws

Melbourne's strong winds and temperature changes cause significant expansion/contraction, leading to ridge cap movement.

**Solution:** Professional rebedding with **SupaPoint** flexible mortar system.

## 3. Damaged Tiles

**Common problems:**
- Hair-line thermal cracks
- Broken tiles from hail
- Sliding tiles from failed fixings
- Lifted tiles exposing underlay

**Melbourne impact:**

**Fix:** Individual replacement with matching materials and secure fixing.

**Warning signs:**

- Plant growth

**Melbourne challenges:**
- Heavy autumn leaf fall
- Sudden downpours
- Freeze-thaw cycles

**Maintenance:** Regular cleaning, realignment, Colorbond replacements.

## 5. Valley Iron & Flashing Failure

**Monitor these areas:**
- Valley intersections

- Vent penetrations

**Failure signs:**
- Rust or corrosion
